# 🌐 **Cyber Management System**

Welcome to the **Cyber Management System**! This project was developed to streamline the management of cyber environments such as cybercafes and coworking spaces. Even though I was just starting out in my first year, I poured my enthusiasm into creating a system that effectively manages user and admin interactions.

### 🚀 **Project Overview**
This system provides an intuitive interface for both administrators and users, focusing on efficient management and robust security features.

### 🔑 **Key Features**

1. **🧑‍💻 User and Admin Interfaces**
   - **Distinct Experiences:** Tailored interaction experiences for users and admins, ensuring that each has access to appropriate functionalities based on their role.

2. **🔐 Secure Authentication**
   - **Robust Security:** Implemented a secure authentication system to manage user access with verification against stored credentials.

3. **🗃️ File-Based Data Storage**
   - **Simplicity in Storage:** Utilized text files for storing user records and login credentials, simplifying setup and avoiding the need for a complex database system.

4. **🕒 Real-Time Arrival Time Display**
   - **Instant Feedback:** Provides real-time feedback to administrators by displaying the current arrival time of users during record insertion.

5. **⚠️ Malicious Activity Alert**
   - **Enhanced Security:** Detects and alerts administrators about potentially malicious activity, adding an extra layer of security and oversight.
